# üè† Home Server Deployment

This repository holds my docker compose files and configuration files for services I host on my homelab. For a while I have been experimenting with different recipies and services to see what works. Whilst this is a public repository, my needs may not be the same as yours, but feel free to fork this and tweak it as you desire.

## Overview

Due to the number of services being deployed, I have categorized them and created a docker compose file for each category. These docker compose files are aggregated together by a script which allows you to treat all of them as if they were a single file.

<sup>1</sup>Assumes mass storage available, mounted at `/storage` on the host.

<sup>2</sup>All traffic is routed via wireguard VPN client container.

## Prerequisites
**Hardware**: I run this on my budget home server which is an x86 dual core system with hyper-threading & 16GB memory. Generally these services do not consume much CPU resources, I would recommend more than 8GB of memory since just starting all of the services in the current state consumes over 7gigs. I do have to turn off transcoding in Plex as my server is just not up to the task, I rely on direct play or streaming over VLC with UPnP if the app cannot handle it for any particular device. Storage requirement is about 9GB+ (according to Portainer) just for the images, downloading content via Deemix, Sonarr & Radarr will **obviously** require some kind of mass storage.

**Sofware**: A linux-based operating system with [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) & [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

## Installation

**Clone the Github repository**
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ben-pearce/home-server-deployment && cd home-server-deployment
```

**Copy both example.config and example.env**
```
cp -rp example.config .config && cp -rp example.env .env
```

**Edit .env and [other config files](https://github.com/ben-pearce/home-server-deployment/tree/main/example.config) as desired**
```
vi .env
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è If migrating data, copy the .data directory from previous installation now.**

**Bring up the container network**
```
./aggregate-docker-compose.sh up -d
```
> üí≠ The `aggregate-docker-compose.sh` script can be treated exactly like `docker-compose` command. 

## Configuration
The `.env` file stores environment variables to make starting the containers easy. This should be modified to match your needs before starting the containers for the first time.

| **Variable** | **Description** | **Example** |
|---|---|---|
| `HOST` | The main host for web-based services.<sup>3</sup> | `example.com` |
| `PUID` | System user ID to run containers as. | 1000 |
| `GUID` | System group ID to run containers as. | 1000 |
| `TZ` | Timezone for all containers. | `Europe/London` |
| `FIRST_MAIL_DOMAIN_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Password for `postmaster` mail inbox. | `password123!` |
| `MLMMJADMIN_API_TOKEN` | Unique key, use `openssl rand -base64 32`. | `ePbfRkaXNZMU...` |
| `ROUNDCUBE_DES_KEY` | Unique key, use `openssl rand -base64 32`. | `ePbfRkaXNZMU...` |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Postgres database password. | `password123!` |
| `APP_KEY` | Laravel app key, use `echo "base64:$(openssl rand -base64 32)"`. | `base64:...` |

<sup>3</sup>Note that you need to also point DNS records for sub-domains since some containers' web GUI cannot operate without their own domain.

## Ideas 

I don't have any kind of project road map or plan for this, since I generally just tinker with & improve things in my free time. I do have a to-do list with services I would like to include, but this list is not exhaustive, and I frequently add things which are not on the list or remove items from the list I no longer think are worthwhile.

## Contributions

First of all, **thanks for your interest!** But due to this being a personal project of mine tailored to my own needs, I cannot accept pull requests on this repository. Please feel free to fork and tweak this project though, and if you wish you can also open an issue to make suggestions for improvement and showcase your own homelab setups based off of this repo!

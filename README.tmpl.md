# 🏠 Home Server Deployment

This repository holds my docker compose files and configuration files for services I host on my homelab. For a while I have been experimenting with different recipies and services to see what works. Whilst this is a public repository, my needs may not be the same as yours, but feel free to fork this and tweak it as you desire.

## Overview

Due to the number of services being deployed, I have categorized them and created a docker compose file for each category. These docker compose files are aggregated together by a script which allows you to treat all of them as if they were a single file.

## Containers

{containers}

## Prerequisites

A linux-based operating system with [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed.

## Installation

**Clone the Github repository**
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ben-pearce/home-server-deployment && cd home-server-deployment
```

**Copy both example.config and example.env**
```
cp -rp example.config .config && cp -rp example.env .env
```

**Edit .env and [other config files](https://github.com/ben-pearce/home-server-deployment/tree/main/example.config) as desired**
```
vi .env
```

> **⚠️ If migrating data, copy the .data directory from previous installation now.**

**Bring up the container network**
```
./aggregate-docker-compose.sh up -d
```
> 💭 The `aggregate-docker-compose.sh` script can be treated exactly like `docker-compose` command. 

## Configuration
The `.env` file stores environment variables to make starting the containers easy. This should be modified to match your needs before starting the containers for the first time.

## Ideas 

I don't have any kind of project road map or plan for this, since I generally just tinker with & improve things in my free time. I do have a to-do list with services I would like to include, but this list is not exhaustive, and I frequently add things which are not on the list or remove items from the list I no longer think are worthwhile.

## Contributions

First of all, **thanks for your interest!** But due to this being a personal project of mine tailored to my own needs, I cannot accept pull requests on this repository. Please feel free to fork and tweak this project though, and if you wish you can also open an issue to make suggestions for improvement and showcase your own homelab setups based off of this repo!
